/**
 * Public API tests of classes in the {@code org.jboss.dmr} package and subpackages.
 * The basic reason for this test package instead of just sticking the tests in the
 * main packages is to have some callers for public methods in
 * a different package so IDEs will stop suggesting we make the public methods
 * package protected.
